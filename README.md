## Contents of files

1, problem_set_1.py contains the solution to problem "Write a program that asks the user to ...input any poisitive integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between one and that number." 

2, problem_set_2.py contains the solution to problem "Write a program that outputs whether or ...not today is a day that begins with the letter T. An example of running this program on a ...Thursday is as follows."
>Please enter a positive integer: 22
>An initial positive integer is 22 and the output is: [11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]


3, problem_set_3.py contains the solution to problem "Write a program that prints all numbers ...between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12."

4, problem_set_4.py contains the solution to problem "Write a program that asks the user to ...input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At ...each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it ...by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the ...current value is one."
